    "In this notebook I will demonstrate how to use the [Julia Programming Language](https://julialang.org) and the powerful [JuMP](https://jump.dev) optimization framework to solve common business problems using Operations Research techniques.\n",

    "<!--Much of the recent hype surrounding Machine learning has drawn attention away from these well established and highly valuable problem solving techniques. I was originally drawn to study operations research while working as a Data Scientist for a large oil company.  Within the organization there was a huge push for data science to revifify a struggling business (now in chapter 11 bankruptcy...) and managers were eager to demonstrate machine learning had a role to play in the business' resurrection.  My job was to apply data science techniques throughout the entire organization, wherever valuable opportunities might present themselves.-->\n"

    "<!---Shamefully absent from the many \"How to be a Data Scientist\" medium posts is quality advice on how to successfully add value within your business. Speaking from experience it is incredibly challenging, particularly when starting from scratch, *but*  there is an entire 70+ year old field that had been studying how to do it... For some reason, NOBODY TALKS ABOUT IT!  Ask yourselves, in all your data science queries on the internet, twitter feeds, etc how often do you hear people say \"Operations Research\" or (synonym) \"Management Science?\"  I'd be shocked if anyone responded \"often,\" yet that is precisely what the field is about.  Not only does it study how to perform scientific research on business processes, but how to grapple with very large and complex problems within the business.  I'm talking things like huge infrastructure projects, manufacturing projects, aerospace and defense projects. The types of projects where success can have huge impact on the bottom line. Naturally the size of these projects drew investment into research so as to increase the probability of success.\n",
    "\n",
    "So there I was, thinking deeply about how I was going to be successful in my new role when I stumbled upon a huge body of literature about how to do exactly what I wanted.  The amount of research is tremendous, so I would suggest against diving in straight away. Instead, start with a textbook like the one above that will more gently carry you through the significant advancements, and dive more deeply only when necessary for a specific problem.  Introduction to Operations Research is FULL of case studies and links to even more case studies where businesses saved or made $10_000_000+ with the very same techniques I will demonstrate. \n",
    "\n",
    "With that in mind, lets get started learning how to apply the great Julia language to solving these problems in the workplace. I'll start with some simple examples of \"linear programming\" which is the class of problems that includes resource allocation, and we'll move on to more challenging problems from there. --->"
