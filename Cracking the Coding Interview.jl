### Chapter 1

# Problem 1
# Is Unique: A. Implement an algorithm to determine if a string has all unique characters.
# B. What if you cannot use additional data structions?

using Random

# I want to determine if each of the items in the string sample is unique
# This involves constructing a list of each element and their counts, and determining if the count is > 1

# B what if you cannot use additional data structures?
# I would have to: For character in my string I would iterate over the remaining characters and test equality.
# If I found a match I would exit the function

# Problem 2:
# Check Permutation: Given two strings, write a method to decide if one is a permutation of the other
# I would define a permutation as follows. The trivial permutation: which is a map of string S to itself.
# The nontrivial permutation. Which has the following properties: it contains the same set of characters with the same quantity of each.
# Using the code above I would first test for equality. Then test for string length equality. Then construct two dicts as above and test their individual char counts.

# Problem 3
# URLify: write a method to replace all spaces in a string with '%20'.
# You may assume that the sting has sufficent space at the end to hold the additional characters, and that you are given the "true"
# length of the string.

# what is the "true" length of the string?
