# Is Unique: A. Implement an algorithm to determine if a string has all unique characters.
# B. What if you cannot use additional data structions?

# I want to determine if each of the items in the string sample is unique
# This involves constructing a list of each element and their counts, and determining if the count is > 1

# B what if you cannot use additional data structures?
# I would have to: For character in my string I would iterate over the remaining characters and test equality.
# If I found a match I would exit the function

# Problem 2:
# Check Permutation: Given two strings, write a method to decide if one is a permutation of the other
# I would define a permutation as follows. The trivial permutation: which is a map of string S to itself.
# The nontrivial permutation. Which has the following properties: it contains the same set of characters with the same quantity of each.
# Using the code above I would first test for equality. Then test for string length equality. Then construct two dicts as above and test their individual char counts.

# Problem 3
# URLify: write a method to replace all spaces in a string with '%20'.
# You may assume that the sting has sufficent space at the end to hold the additional characters, and that you are given the "true"
# length of the string.

# what is the "true" length of the string?

# Problem 4
# PALINDROME PERMUTATION: Given a string, write a function to check if it is a permutation of a palindrome.


# Some interesting properties of palindromes. They are symmetric about a pivot, which is partition line if the length of the sting is even, or a letter if the length of the string is odd.
# So an odd length string would have an even number of each character except the for one, which would be odd.
# An even length string would have and even number of each character.

# PROBLEM 5
# ONE AWAY: there are three types of edits that can be performed on strings: Insert a character
# remove a character, or replace a character. Given two strings, write a function to check if they are only at most one edit away.

# Ok basically I need see if there is a length difference, or if there is a difference in the characters
# Then I can keep a running counter of the edits

# Basically my approach will be to iterate through each of the strings and compare an element deleted version to the other. If the element deleted versions match in length - 1 occurances
# then the two strings are only one edit away.
